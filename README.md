Stackoverflow Visual Recommender

With more and more programmers booming, an intuitive code editor for java programming language will be more helpful. In addition, considering the abundance of code  available online on discussion forums and on other websites, an interface which helps programmers to use the available code is a need which has not been satiated yet. The idea of making a code editor more intuitive to learn a programming language is the seed. The stackoverflow Q&A forum dataset is our primary data source. When a line of code is typed by the user, the line is searched in the available dataset. Based on an n-gram model, frequency is calculated and the next most possible line is suggested. This will enable the user to know what other coders have previously typed. Along with the most possible next words the most relevant questions that was up-voted by many user, related to the line entered by the user is suggested, for the case the user wants to find posts that are relevant to what they have entered. The prototype uses D3 charts to display the results rather than sequential alignment of question-answer
and recommendation.
